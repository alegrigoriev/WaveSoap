<h1>Wave outline bar</h1>

<p><img border="0" src="../images/OutlineBar.png"></p>
<p>Outline bar shows all the file, where the visible part is located, what part
is selected, and the sound playback cursor.</p>
<p>Currently visible area is outlined with a black rectangle.</p>
<p>The selected area is shown with darker background.</p>
<p>You can quickly move to any part of the file, by clicking in the outline
bar. You can also select an area in the file, by holding the mouse left button 
down and dragging it along the outline bar. Note that when you click on the 
outline, the current edit point will be set to the sample with maximum 
amplitude.</p>
<p>Markers and region boundaries are shown in the outline bar as dotted lines. 
If you click on it, the current edit point (caret) will be moved there. If you 
hold the mouse cursor over it, a tooltip will show the marker or region name.</p>
<p>Double click between two markers or region boundaries will select that area.</p>
<p>Even though the file may contain stereo sound, the outline shows both
channels combined to one timeline.</p>
<p>You can turn the outline off and back on by using <a href="outline_command.htm">Outline</a>
command of <a href="menu_view.htm">View</a> menu, or by Alt+3 keyboard shortcut.</p>
