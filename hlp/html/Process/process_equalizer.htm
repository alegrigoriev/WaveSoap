<h3><B>Equializer command (<a href="process_menu.htm">Process menu</a>)</B></h3>

<P>Use this command to boost or attenuate selected frequency bands. Simple and 
graphic equalizer (up to 20 bands) modes are supported. Each band can be 
adjusted by +/-20 dB.</P>
<P>The following dialog box is shown:</P>

<p>The dialog can be resized by dragging on the border, to enlarge the graph 
window.</p>
<p>The frequency scale is logarithmic. This means the ratio between two adjacent 
frequency bands is the same.</p>
<p>Each band can be adjusted by dragging the small circle

(fader) with the mouse up and down. Keyboard arrow keys can also be used. Left 
and right arrow keys switch to another band. Up and down arrows change the 
response by 1 dB at a time, in the selected band, which is shown with black 
circle.</p>
<p><b>Frequency response in the selected band</b> edit box shows how much the 
sound will be boosted or suppressed. Each 6 dB correspond to two times amplitude 
change.</p>
<p><b>Zero phase shift</b> checkbox selects whether the equalizer should have no 
phase distortion. The command then takes more time to execute.</p>
<p><b>Simple/Multiband</b> buttons allow to select equalizer type. Multiband is 
shown above. The number of bands can be set from 3 to 20. Simple equalizer only 
allows Bass/Treble adjustments:</p>

<p><b>Save As</b> button allows to save the settings to a file.</p>
<p><b>Load</b> button allows to load saved settings.</p>
<P><b>Save Undo</b> checkbox enables undoing the operation. If it's not checked, 
you won't be able to undo the operation and all previous operations.</P>
<P><b>Selection</b> button allows to specify range and channels to perform the 
operation. It opens a
