<title>Process/Resample... menu command</title>

<body>

<h3><b>Process/Resample... menu command</b></h3>
<p>This command allows you to change the sound sample rate, while preserving its 
tempo/pitch. It can also change the sound tempo/pitch, while keeping the 
playback sample rate.</p>
<p>The resampling algorithm is described <a href="#ResampleBasics">here</a>.</p>
<p>You may want to resample the sound to correct wrong playback rate of the 
analog media. Or you may need different target sample rate, than your source 
sound material was recorded with.</p>
<p>Note that this command doesn't allow to change pitch while keeping the tempo 
unchanged.</p>
<p>When you execute Process/Resample... command in the menu, the following 
dialog appears:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/dlg_resample.png"></p>
<p>If you select &quot;<b>Change sampling rate</b>&quot; and enter the new sampling rate 
value, the whole file gets processed. Tempo/pitch is preserved. You can enter 
new sampling rate from 1/4 to 4 times the original sample rate.</p>
<p>If you select &quot;<b>Change tempo and pitch</b>&quot; and enter the tempo change in 
percents (100% means no change, &lt;100% is slower playback, &gt;100% means faster 
playback), the whole file gets processed. The sample rate in the file attributes 
won't change, but the total number of samples and the file duration will.</p>
<p>If &quot;<b>Change sampling rate only, do not resample data</b>&quot; checkbox is 
marked, the sampling rate will only be changed in the file attributes, but the 
sound data itself is not changed with this operation. The same operation can be 
done with <a href="../MainWindow/menu_sample_rate_popup.htm">sample rate popup menu</a>.</p>
<p><b><a name="ResampleBasics"></a>How resample is done</b></p>
<p>Sound samples are signal measurements, taken at come constant rate. </p>
<p>Without going deep to theory, it's enough to say that sample rate should be 
more that twice the highest frequency in the source signal (Nyquist rule).</p>
<p>If, given samples taken with rate F1, one wants to find the samples taken 
with rate F2, one solution would be to completely restore the original signal 
from F1 samples, and then take samples with new rate.</p>
<p>Since it's not feasible to exactly restore the source signal, some 
approximation techniques are used. One low-quality approach is to use 
combination of decimation (throwing out extra samples), and interpolation. 
Unfortunately, this gives a lot of artifacts, and the signal spectrum becomes 
very polluted.</p>
<p>The modern approach to resample is use of sliding finite-impulse-response 
filter. The filter coefficients are calculated on the fly for each sample. This 
gives decent resampling quality.</p>
