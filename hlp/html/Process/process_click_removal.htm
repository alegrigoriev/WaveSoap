<h3><B>Click Removal command </B></h3>
<P><B>(<a href="process_menu.htm">Process menu</a> 
Sound Cleanup submenu)</B></P>

<P>Use this command to automatically remove click which are part of a vinyl LP 
record.</P>

<P><B>Shortcuts:</B></P>

<P>Toolbar:<IMG SRC="../../images/ProcessDeclick.png" ALT="" BORDER=0 width="21" height="20"></P>

<P>Not all clicks can be reliably found and removed. It is recommended to 
manually clean the sound first from the largest clicks, using
<a href="../Tools/tools_interpolate.htm">Interpolate</a> command, and only 
then use automated Click Removal command.</P>

<p>The following dialog is opened as the menu command is selected:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/ClickRemovalDialog.png"></p>
<p>The click detection algorithm uses the following parameters:</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;Minimum click amplitude</b> - minimum spike height to be considered 
a click. Valid range is from 50 to 5000, default is 200.</p>
<p><b>Click to noise ratio</b> - how many times a click amplitude should be more 
than the filtered noise envelope. The sound is passed through a filter to 
suppress all data not click-alike. Valid range is from 1.5 to 20, default is 4.</p>
<p><b>Maximum click length </b>- maximum length that the program will try to 
interpolate. Valid range is from 6 to 64, default is 32.</p>
<p><b>Noise attack rate</b> - noise envelope filter constant, used when the 
noise amplitude increases. Valid range is from 0.001 to 0.99, default is 0.5. 
Higher values mean the program will accept sharp increases in high frequencies 
without taking them for a click, but is less likely to detect a click.</p>
<p><b>Click proximity factor </b>- noise envelope filter constant, used when the 
noise amplitude decreases. Valid range is from 0.001 to 0.99, default is 0.01. 
Higher values mean the program will detect clicks that are closer, but false 
detection is more likely.</p>
<p><b>Import clicks from a file</b> checkbox and an edit box - when checked, the 
clicks positions and lengths will be read from a text file, instead of running 
detection algorithm. The file name should be typed into an edit box, or selected 
with &quot;Browse&quot; button next to it.</p>
<p><b>Log all found clicks to a file</b> checkbox and an edit box - when 
checked, the clicks positions and lengths will be written to a text file. The 
file name should be typed into an edit box, or selected with &quot;Browse&quot; button 
next to it. If &quot;<b>Log clicks only, don't change the wave</b>&quot; box is checked, 
the actual clicks won't be removed. Only detection will run.</p>
<p><b>Set defaults</b> button reset all values to defaults.</p>
<p><b>Revert</b> button resets all values to those loaded when the dialog was 
opened.</p>
<p><b>Save</b> button saves the current settings to a text file. <b>Load </b>
button loads previously saved settings.</p>
<P><b>Save Undo</b> checkbox enables undoing the operation. If it's not checked, 
you won't be able to undo the operation and all previous operations.</P>
<P><b>Selection</b> button allows to specify range and channels to perform the 
operation. It opens a
<a href="file:///D:/My%20Projects/WaveSoap/hlp/html/Dialogs/Selection/SelectionDialog.htm">
selection dialog</a>.</P>
