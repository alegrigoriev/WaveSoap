<h3><B>White Noise Reduction&nbsp;command (<a href="process_menu.htm">Process menu</a>)</B></h3>

<P>Use this command to suppress hiss (white noise). The algorithm is described
<a href="#algorithm">here</a>.</P>
<P>The following dialog box is shown:</P>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/NoiseReductionDialog.png"></p>

<p><span lang="en-us">The edit boxes have the following meaning:</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Apply noise reduction to frequencies higher than</b>&quot; 
- specifies what frequencies are subject to noise suppression. The allowed range 
is from 100 to 48000.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>FFT order to analyze</b>&quot; - drop-down list selects how 
many frequency bands the source signal is decomposed to. The values are powers 
of 2, from 256 to 16384.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Noise floor for higher frequencies</b>&quot; - what level 
is considered noise, in dB, on the high side of the frequency range. The allowed 
range is from -120 to -10 dB.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Noise floor for lower frequencies</b>&quot; - what level is 
considered noise, in dB, on the low side of the frequency range. The allowed 
range is from -120 to -10 dB.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Noise reduction aggressiveness</b>&quot; - how 
aggressive should be noise suppression. The allowed range is from 0.1 to 3.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Maximum noise reduction</b>&quot; - maximum 
suppression of noise. The allowed range is from 0 to 100 dB. </span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Tone over noise preference</b>&quot; - how much 
tonal signal should be given preference over noise-like. The allowed range is 
from 0 to 20 dB.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Continuous tone detection threshold</b>&quot; - 
criterion to distinguish tone from noise. The allowed range is from 0 to 1.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Transient area threshold</b>&quot; - TODO.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Set default</b>&quot; button reverts all the values to defaults.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Revert</b>&quot; button returns all values to those when the 
dialog was open.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Save</b>&quot; button allows to save the noise reduction settings 
to a file.</span></p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>Load</b>&quot; button loads previously saved settings.</span></p>
<P><b>&quot;Save Undo&quot;</b> checkbox enables undoing the operation. If it's not checked, 
you won't be able to undo the operation and all previous operations.</P>
<P><b>&quot;Selection&quot;</b> button allows to specify range and channels to perform the 
operation. It opens a
<a href="../Dialogs/Selection/SelectionDialog.htm">selection dialog</a>.</P>

<p><a name="show_noise_mask"></a>&quot;<b>Show spectrum and noise threshold</b>&quot; button opens the
<a href="../MainWindow/spectrum_section_pane.htm">spectrum section pane</a> and 
shows the masking function. It allows to see how the chosen noise reduction 
parameters match the source.</p>
<p><span lang="en-us">&quot;<b>More settings</b>&quot; opens the following dialog:</span></p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/MoreNoiseSettingsDialog.png"></p>
<p>The edit fields have the following meaning:</p>
<p>&quot;<b>Far noise masking</b>&quot; - specifies how much of the band power is spread 
over the whole frequency range.<span lang="en-us">The allowed range is from -100 
to -10 dB</span>, default is <span lang="en-us">-40.</span></p>
<p>&quot;<b>Near masking decay distance for lower frequencies</b>&quot; - specifies how 
far a strong signal masks the adjacent frequency bands. The allowed range is 
from 1 to 1000 Hz, default is 100.</p>

<p>&quot;<b>Near masking decay distance for higher frequencies</b>&quot; - specifies how 
far a strong signal masks the adjacent frequency bands. The allowed range is 
from 1 to 5000 Hz, default is 1000.</p>

<p>&quot;<b>Decay time of noise masking for lower frequencies</b>&quot; - specifies how 
quickly the masking function decays with time, on the lower frequencies. The 
allowed range is from 1 to 1000 ms, default is 100.</p>

<p>&quot;<b>Decay time of noise masking for higher frequencies</b>&quot; - specifies how 
quickly the masking function decays with time, on the lower frequencies. The 
allowed range is from 1 to 1000 ms, default is 40.</p>
<p>&quot;<b>Far masking decay</b>&quot; - TODO</p>

<h4><a name="algorithm"></a>Noise reduction algorithm</h4>
<P>The noise reduction process involves decomposing the sound to a specified 
number of frequency bands using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The
<span lang="en-us">signal </span>power in each 
of those bands is analyzed to calculate its masking function, an example shown 
below:</P>
<P><img border="0" src="../../images/NoiseMaskingFunction.png"></P>
<P>The masking function tells whether a particular frequency band contains useful signal or 
noise, should it be suppressed and for how much. Where the masking function is 
greater than noise threshold, it's considered useful sound; where it's below, 
it's considered noise and is reduced. Logarithmic difference between masking 
function and noise threshold is multiplied by aggressiveness factor. This 
specifies how much the bend power should be suppressed.</P>
<P>Then the signal is synthesized 
back from the adjusted FFT data. Special care is taken to avoid suppressing 
attack <span lang="en-us">envelope</span>.</P>
