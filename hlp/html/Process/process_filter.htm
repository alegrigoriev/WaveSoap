<h3><B>Filter&nbsp;command (<a href="process_menu.htm">Process menu</a>)</B></h3>

<P>Use this command to suppress all sound below or above specified frequency, or 
suppress one specified frequency.</P>
<P>The following dialog box is shown:</P>
<P><img border="0" src="../../images/FilterDialog.png"></P>

<p>The graph shows the frequency response of the filter.</p>

<p>The frequency scale is logarithmic. This means the ratio between two adjacent 
dotted lines is the same.</p>

<p>The dialog can be resized by dragging on the border, to enlarge the graph 
window.</p>
<p>The filter consists of three components that can be enabled or disabled 
separately:</p>
<p><b>Highpass filter</b>: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/HighPassFilter.png"></p>
<p>It suppresses frequencies below the specified passband.</p>
<p>Highpass filter is described by four parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>passband frequency, in Hz;</li>
  <li>maximum transfer loss above passband frequency, in dB;</li>
  <li>stopband frequency (lower than passband) in Hz;</li>
  <li>minimum transfer loss on stopband frequency and below, in dB;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Lowpass filter</b>: </p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/LowPassFilter.png"></p>
<p>It suppresses frequencies above the specified passband.</p>
<p>Lowpass filter is described by four parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>passband frequency, in Hz;</li>
  <li>maximum transfer loss below passband frequency, in dB;</li>
  <li>stopband frequency (higher than passband) in Hz;</li>
  <li>minimum transfer loss on stopband frequency and above, in dB;</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Notch filter</b>:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/NotchFilter.png"></p>
<p>It suppresses frequencies in the narrow stopband.</p>
<p>Notch filter is described by two parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Center frequency, in Hz. The filter has theoretical zero transfer on this frequency;</li>
  <li>passband width on -3dB transfer, in Hz. The graph shows lower boundary of the band.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parameters of the filters can be set either by entering them in the edit 
boxes, or by using the mouse to dragg the reference points on the graph.</p>
<p>Each filter has two reference pointes. One is on the passband boundary, 
another is on the stopband.</p>
<p>You can drag them up and down, increasing or 
decreasing desired signal loss. You can drag them sideways, changing the 
boundary frequencies. Dragging a reference point while holding <b>Ctrl</b> key 
will change both frequencies at the same time, keeping constant ratio between 
them.</p>
<p>Keyboard can also be used. A reference point with input focus is shown as a 
small blinking circle. <b>Left arrow</b> and <b>right arrow</b> keys switch the 
focus to the next reference point. <b>Shift+Left Arrow</b> and <b>Shift+Right 
Arrow </b>keys move a reference point on the frequency axis. <b>Ctrl+Left Arrow</b> 
and <b>Ctrl+Right Arrow </b>keys move both reference points at the same time, 
keeping constant ratio between them. <b>Up Arrow </b>and <b>&nbsp;Down 
Arrow </b>keys move the reference point by 1 dB at a time.</p>

<p><b>Highpass filter</b>, <b>Notch Filter</b> and <b>Lowpass Filter</b> 
checkboxes enable the corresponding filters. </p>
<p><b>Passband transfer </b>edit box specifies maximum 
loss for the selected filter, whose reference point is shown as a small 
black circle. Valid range is from -20 dB to 0. An edit box next to it specifies its corresponding frequency.</p>
<p><b>Stopband transfer</b> edit box specifies minimum loss for the selected filter, 
whose reference point is shown as a small black circle. Valid range is from -120 
dB to 0. An edit box next to it specifies its corresponding frequency.</p>
<p><b>Zero phase shift</b> checkbox selects whether the filter should have no 
phase distortion. The command then takes more time to execute.</p>
<p><b>Reset </b>button returns all filters to default parameters..</p>
<p><b>Save As</b> button allows to save the settings to a file.</p>
<p><b>Load</b> button allows to load saved settings.</p>
<P><b>Save Undo</b> checkbox enables undoing the operation. If it's not checked, 
you won't be able to undo the operation and all previous operations.</P>
<P><b>Selection</b> button allows to specify range and channels to perform the 
operation. It opens a
<a href="../Dialogs/Selection/SelectionDialog.htm">selection dialog</a>.</P>
