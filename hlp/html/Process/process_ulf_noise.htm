<h3><B>Turntable Noise Reduction command </B></h3>
<P><B>(<a href="process_menu.htm">Process menu</a> 
Sound Cleanup submenu)</B></P>

<P>Use this command to remove low-frequency static from the vinyl LP recording.</P>

<P><B>Shortcuts:</B></P>

<p>Two components are considered: ultra-low frequency common mode noise 
(&quot;horizontal wobble&quot;), and differential mode noise caused by the disk warp 
(&quot;vertical wobble&quot;). The latter shows up as opposite waves in the left and right 
channels (the wave view is magnified):</p>

<p>This is a recording from lead-in zone. As you can see, the wobble can reach about 3% of the full amplitude range.</p>
<p>The following dialog is opened as the menu command is selected:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/UlfReductionDialog.png"></p>
<p><b>Suppress &quot;Vertical wobble&quot; noise up to: </b>check mark enables it, and the 
edit box specifies the frequency range to suppress. Allowed range is from 1 to 
1000 Hz, default value is 200 Hz.</p>
<p><b>Suppress low frequencies up to: </b>check mark enables it, and the edit 
box specifies the frequency range to suppress. Allowed range is from 1 to 1000 
Hz, default value is 20 Hz.</p>
<P><b>Save Undo</b> checkbox enables undoing the operation. If it's not checked, 
you won't be able to undo the operation and all previous operations.</P>
<P><b>Selection</b> button allows to specify range and channels to perform the 
operation. It opens a
<a href="../Dialogs/Selection/SelectionDialog.htm">selection dialog</a>.</P>

<p>Here is the sound shown above, after the low frequency suppression is 
applied:</p>
