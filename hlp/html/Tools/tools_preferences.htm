be saved in WAV files.</p>
<ul>

  language settings, the labels and other text data may be shown incorrectly. 
  This is the standard format used by most sound editing applications.</li>
  <li><b>UTF-8</b> - the text will be saved using UTF-8 representation of 
  UNICODE character set. Such representation doesn't depend on the language 
  settings. Most languages are supported by default. This is a format extension 
  and may not be supported in other applications.</li>
  <li><b>UTF-16</b> - the text will be saved using UTF-16 representation of 
  UNICODE character set. Such representation doesn't depend on the language
