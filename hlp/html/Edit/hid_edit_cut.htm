<P><B>Cut command (<a href="menu_edit.htm">Edit menu</a>)</B></P>

<P>Use this command to remove the currently selected sound data from the file and put it on the 
<a href="../clipboard.htm">clipboard</a>.  This command is unavailable if there is no data currently selected 
or the file is open as read-only.</P>

<P>Cutting sound data to the clipboard replaces the contents previously stored there.</P>

<P>The stored data can be inserted to this or another open sound file, by 
performing <a href="hid_edit_paste.htm">Edit Paste</a> command.</P>
<P>The stored data can also be used to create a new sound file, by selecting
<a href="../File/file_new_from_clipboard.htm">Edit/Paste As New File</a> 
command.</P>

<P><b>NOTE: </b>If only one channel of the stereo file is selected, cutting a selection will cause offset between channels. If you don't want that, make 
sure both channels are selected, or
<a href="file:///D:/My%20Projects/WaveSoap/hlp/html/Edit/hid_lock_channels.htm">
Lock Channels</a> is checked.</P>
