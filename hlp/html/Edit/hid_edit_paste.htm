<h3><B>Paste command (<a href="menu_edit.htm">Edit menu</a>)</B></h3>

<P>Use this command to insert a copy of the clipboard contents at the insertion point.  This command is unavailable if the clipboard is empty.</P>
<P>If the clipboard data has different sample rate that the target file, 
WaveSoap asks:</P>
<P><img border="0" src="../../images/ResampleOnPaste.png"></P>
<P><b>Resample the clipboard contents on paste - </b>the data will be converted 
to the target sample rate.</P>
<P><b>Paste sound samples as is, without resampling</b> - the data will be 
inserted as if the sample rate is the same.</P>

<P>If the data stored in the clipboard has more channels than the target file or 
selection, WaveSoap asks what to do:</P>
<P><img border="0" src="../../images/SelectSourceChannel.png"></P>
<P>If there is a non-empty selection, WaveSoap asks:</P>
<P><img border="0" src="../../images/SelectPasteDestination.png"></P>
<P><b>Replace selection with the clipboard contents</b> <b>&nbsp;- </b>the 
clipboard selection will replace the selection, shrinking or expanding the file, 
as necessary.</P>
<P><b>Paste as much as selection length </b>- no more than selected will be 
pasted. The file length will not change.</P>
<P><b>Insert clipboard data at current caret position</b> - just insert the 
clipboard at the current edit point. The file will be expanded.</P>
<P><b>NOTE: </b>If only one channel of the stereo file is selected, inserting 
the clipboard contents will cause offset between channels. If you don't want that, make 
sure both channels are selected, or
<a href="hid_lock_channels.htm">Lock Channels</a> button is checked, like
