<h2>How to navigate in the sound file</h2>

<p>There are various means to move around in the sound file.</p>
<p>The current edit point is shown as a blinking vertical line, called <i>caret</i>, 
like one in a text editor. The caret may cover both channels of a stereo file, 
or one of them.</p>
<p>You can use <b>arrow keys</b> to move the edit point by one pixel to the left or 
right.</p>
<p>You can click in the waveform view, to set the edit point wherever you want.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="Edit/hid_edit_goto.htm">Edit/Go To</a> command to move 
to a position specified in time units (Shortcut: Ctrl+G).</p>
<p>You can click in the <a href="MainWindow/wave_outline_view.htm">outline bar</a>, 
to move to the corresponding position in the file. If <a href="Tools/tools_preferences.htm#snap_to_max">Snap mouse 
position to selection</a> option is enabled in the Preferences dialog, the edit 
point will be set to the peak sample position. If you click on a marker or a 
region boundary (depicted as a dotted line), the edit point will be set to it.</p>

<p><b>Ctrl+Left Arrow</b> moves the edit point to the next marker or region boundary, 
or to the end of file.</p>
<p><b>Ctrl+Right Arrow</b> moves the edit point to the previous marker or region 
boundary, or to the beginning of file.</p>
<p><b>Home</b> key moves the edit point to the beginning of the current selection.</p>
<p><b>End </b>key moves the edit point to the end of the current selection.</p>
<p><b>Ctrl+Home</b> key moves the edit point to the beginning of file.</p>
<p><b>Ctrl+End </b>key moves the edit point to the end of file.</p>
<p><b>Page Up</b> and <b>Page Down </b>&nbsp;keys move the edit point 
correspondingly backward and forward, by a screen worth of sound.</p>
<p>Note than when <b>Shift</b> key is held, most navigation keys will extend the 
selection. For example, <b>Ctrl+Shift+End</b> combination selects from the 
current position to the end of file. Mouse click with <b>Shift</b> held selects 
to the corresponding position.</p>
