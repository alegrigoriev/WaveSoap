<p>Spectrum view shows how the sound energy is distributed among different 
frequencies. The spectrum is calculated using FFT procedure, which stands for 
<b>Fast Fourier Transform</b>.</p>

<p>Lower side of each channel's display corresponds to lower frequencies; upper 
side corresponds to higher frequencies.</p>
<p>Greater power is shown with brighter red and orange colors, lower power is 
shown with darker blue colors.</p>
<p>Selected area is outlined with a wide dotted line.</p>
<p>The frequency is displayed on the left sidebar, at the same place where the
<a href="amplitude_ruler.htm">amplitude ruler </a>is shown for the
<a href="waveform_view.htm">waveform view</a>.</p>

<p>Right-click in the spectrum view opens the popup menu. Besides from usual 
zoom commands, it allows to select number of FFT bands (also called bins) and 
type of FFT windowing function.</p>
<p>Number of FFT bins is power of 2, from 64 to 8192. More bins give better 
resolution in frequency domain, but lower resolution in time, because each FFT 
block takes more source audio samples.</p>
<p><a name="window_type"></a>Each block of source samples is shaped by a chosen FFT window function. 
Without such windowing, it's not possible to separate the frequency bands well 
enough, because energy from one band would bleed (leak) to other bands, far from it. </p>
<p>Window type can be chosen from the following:</p>
<p><b>Squared sine</b> is also known as Hanning window. It has low leakage to 
the far bins, but the sidelobe has -30 dB leakage, which is a bit worse than 
Hamming window.</p>
<p><b>Hamming</b> window (0.54 – 0.46*cos(2*pi * n/N)) has the lowest leak to 
the first bin, but the worst leakage to the far bins. All sidelobes of its 
transfer function are mere -40 dB.</p>
<p><b>Nuttall</b> window: 0.355768 - 0.487396*cos(2*pi * n/N) + 
0.144232*cos(4*pi * n/N) - 0.012604*cos(6*pi * n/N). This is so far the best 
window, but there may be reasons you want to select Hanning or Hamming window.</p>

<p>On the lower end of the ruler, two buttons are shown:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/amplitude_zoom_buttons.png"></p>
<p>The left button is for zooming in, the 
right one is for zooming out.</p>

<p>Keyboard shortcut for zooming <b>in</b> is <b>Alt+Up Arrow</b>.</p>
<p>If you double click on the ruler, the zoom scale is reset back to 100%.</p>
<p>Keyboard shortcut for zooming <b>out</b> is <b>Alt+Down Arrow</b>.</p>
