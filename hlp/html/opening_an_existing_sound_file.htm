<h1 align="center">Opening an existing sound file</h1>
<p align="left">The program supports standard WAV files with uncompressed PCM
data as well as compressed sound data. It also supports MP3 encoded files and
Windows Media files. The files with unsupported internal structure can be opened
as <b>raw</b> sound files.</p>
<p align="left">The files can be opened for editing in <b>direct </b>or <b>buffered</b>
mode, and also in <b>read-only</b> mode.</p>
<p align="left">When a file is opened in <b>direct</b> mode, all editing
operations change the file itself. Only uncompressed WAV files with 16-bit data
can be opened in direct mode. This mode saves some little time when opening a
file.</p>
<p align="left">In <b>buffered</b> mode, though, a temporary file is created,
which holds all the new contents of the file. As you open the 16 bit PCM sound
file, it's content is not copied immediately to the temporary file. It is copied
while you are browsing and editing it. The temporary file is usually created in
the same folder, where the original file is located, to speed file save
operation. 8 bit PCM and compressed files, such as compressed WAV, MP3 and WMA,
take some more time to open, because WaveSoap needs to convert them to 16 bit
PCM format.</p>
<p align="left">Files can also be opened as <b>read only</b>. WaveSoap won't
allow to make any changes in such files.</p>
