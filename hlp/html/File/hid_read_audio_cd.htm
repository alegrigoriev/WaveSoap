<P>If you have more than one CD drive, you can select one with Drive drop-down 
list.</P>
<P>Reading speed can be selected with Extraction speed drop-down list. Some 
low-quality CD drives cannot perform full error correction procedures while 
reading with maximum speed. If you experience data errors (seen as spikes in the 
read audio file), reduce the speed down to 8x or 2x. In Windows XP, you only 
have this option if Adaptec's ASPI is installed, or you're running with 
Administrator rights (which is not generally recommended due to security 
issues).</P>
