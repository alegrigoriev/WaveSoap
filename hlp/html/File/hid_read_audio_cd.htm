<h3><b>Read Audio CD Tracks
command (<a href="menu_file.htm">File menu</a>)</b></h3>

<P>Use this command to convert audio CD tracks to a sound file. You can save it 
as WAV, or MP3, or WMA file.</P>
<P>The command opens the following dialog:</P>
<P><img border="0" src="../../images/CdGrabberDialog.png"></P>
<P>If you have more than one CD drive, you can select one with <b>Drive</b> drop-down 
list.</P>
<P>Reading speed can be selected with <b>Extraction speed</b> drop-down list. Some 
low-quality CD drives cannot perform full error correction procedures while 
reading with maximum speed. If you experience data errors (seen as spikes in the 
read audio file), reduce the speed down to 8x or 2x. In Windows XP, you only 
have this option if Adaptec's ASPI is installed, or you're running with 
Administrator rights (which is not generally recommended due to security 
concerns).</P>
<P><b>Tracks</b> list shows all audio tracks, their names and length. To edit 
the name, select it and press F2 (or click with the mouse on it). Checkboxes 
select what tracks will be processed.</P>
<P>TODO.</P>
<P>Enter the directory path to &quot;<b>Save in</b>&quot; edit field, or select it from 
the drop-down list. You can also click [...] button to browse the directories.</P>
<P>The CD tracks can be saved as uncompressed WAV files, or Windows Media Audio 
(WMA), or as MPEG-1 Layer III (MP3).</P>
<P>The files can be saved immediately, or just opened in the editor.</P>
<P>For WMA and MP3 files, &quot;Format&quot; drop-down list allows to select the files' 
bit rate (measured in kilobits per second - kbps). The higher the bit rate, the 
better is sound quality, but the files take more space.</P>
<P>The program supports LAME MPEG encoder, as well as ACM driver by Fraunhofer 
Institute.</P>
