<h3><B>Save command (<a href="menu_file.htm">File menu</a>)</B></h3>

<P>Use this command to save the active sound file to its current name and directory.  When you save a 
new sound file for the first time, WaveSoap displays the <A HREF="../Dialogs/FileSave/afx_hidd_filesave.htm">Save As dialog box</A>, so you can name your sound file.  </P>
<P>If you want to change the name and directory of an existing sound file before you save it, choose the <A HREF="hid_file_save_as.htm">Save As command</A>.
Use this command also to save the file with different compression or sample 
rate.</P>
<P>You can also save a copy of the open file, by selecting
<a href="hid_save_copy_as.htm">Save Copy command</a>. The original file will 
remain open.</P>
<P>After the file has been saved, the application reloads it. It may prompt you 
how you want the file to be reopen:</P>
<ul>
  <li>If the uncompressed file was originally opened in buffered mode, you have 
  options to reopen in buffered mode again (this will create a new temporary 
  file), reopen it in direct mode to work immediately on the file, or close it 
  altogether.</li>
  <li>If the file was saved with compression, you have options to reload it from 
  the saved copy, or continue working with the current data. Most compression 
  formats have compression loss, and reloaded data may be different from 
  original.</li>
</ul>
